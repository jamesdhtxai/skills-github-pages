Welcome to My AI & Robotics Portfolio

This blog is the starting point of a long-term portfolio I’m building as part of my journey toward a bachelor's degree in AI & Robotics. It's where I’ll be documenting my work, projects, reflections, and key milestones as I develop skills in artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, and beyond.

The idea behind this blog isn’t just to share polished deliverables—it’s to capture growth over time. My professor encourages us to treat this as more than just an assignment. It’s a place to build our voice, showcase how we think, and track how our ideas evolve as we learn more about the technology—and its real-world applications.

Some posts will dive into course-related work, while others might explore side projects, code experiments, or just thoughts on the future of AI. Over time, I hope this becomes a useful and honest record of the work I’m doing—and maybe even something worth sharing with future collaborators, employers, or fellow learners.


To kick things off, my first post is a personal reflection on how I use AI tools like ChatGPT in my daily work—and the ethical tensions that come with it. It’s a blend of lived experience and critical analysis, grounded in readings from Forbes and the Financial Times. This piece sets the tone for the rest of the blog: part case study, part personal lens, and fully engaged with the societal implications of AI.

Thanks for stopping by. Let’s see where this goes.
